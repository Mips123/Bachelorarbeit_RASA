Learning ChatBot for Bachelor Thesis 

This Chatbot can be used to learn a certain set of slides. 

First off, RASA Open Source has to be installed locally. A deployment has not been implemented yet. 

pip3 install rasa

Then, one has to open two terminals in the related directory. 

In the first shell, type the following command to start up the chatbot locally. 

rasa run 

In the second shell, type the following command to start up the action server for custom actions (required!)

rasa run actions

Then you are good to go - run the application in the folder xxx via double click - a shell will open to communicate with the chatbot. Have fun!
